# Widget Image Map

This is a low-tech responsive "image map" widget (image with nodes that highlight/show descriptions).

## Features

- responsive (one major breakpoint, two minor breakpoints)
- CSS organiation (page-specific, project-specific, and core styles)
- minimal JavaScript (only used to close description on small screen)

## Caveats

- The CSS organization makes assumptions about what is shared between instances and projects.
- This is __not__ a component (native web component, React component, etc)

## Notes

The naming and structure inside `assets/core/` and `assets/project/` mirror those of `taccsite_cms/` and `taccsite_custom/` respectively in repo `cms-site-template`.
